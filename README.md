# powerful-password-checker

This is a Python script that checks the security of passwords using the "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP) API.

## Description

The script allows you to check whether a password has been found in a data breach. It does this by sending a partial hash of the password to the HIBP API and checking if there is a match in the database. If a match is found, it means the password has been compromised and should be changed.
